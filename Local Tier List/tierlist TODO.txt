Overall Status: Main requisites functional on Desktop and Android, still could use some QA to find unhandled errors. 
Remaining work is improvement only with no deadlines

Github:
{
	Make an actual Readme, with images of both devices.
	Add Desktop and Android Releases.
}

css it out kinda, not too elaborate
{
	Make Tierlist headers (name input, export, search) prettier
	Make TierList.. List prettier
}

Add formatting support for Tier Item Notes

Find some damn way to center the tier text without breaking everyrthing (!?)

Add way to drag drop Tiers in TierEdit

Add support for Sorting tierlists into folders, with custom colors (maybe using the Content from maiehobbies? but not necessarily)

Optimize Mobile performance
{
	Drag Ghost operation
	Tier Edit open delay
	Slight scrolling lag on showcase mode (due to popups)
}

DONE ------------

(!) Fallback Unloaded images to their text versions

(!) Add support for Tags/Categories and Additional Text (description) for Tier Items (the former for searching specific groups, the latter to add notes to your reasoning for putting it there)

(!) Be able to drag items across itself and other tiers (animation isn't needed)

(!) make tiers show even when empty

(!) fix not being able to drag and drop to empty tier

(!) Add tooltips for every item, showing its name when hovered.

(!) Checkboxes for minimal mode (half the space used) and showcase mode (hide ADD boxes)

(!) Export and Import Tierlists (into json)

(!) Use DragDropApi in Local Tier List, Seperate it into a "MaieUtils" project (if ondragleave works)

(!) Make Mobile Compatible
{
	(!) UI
	(!) Drag and Drop
}
